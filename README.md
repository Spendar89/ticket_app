This script will drive a future rails project.  It parses NBA ticket data and determines the best available seat based on user price range and preference.  Currently, each section of Oracle Arena, home of the Golden State Warriors, is modeled based on proximity to the court.

TODO:

create models of the remaining NBA arenas
generate link for user to purchase ticket
